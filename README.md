# **Eat.Sleep.Data - Predicting Airbnb Prices in Nashville** 

 
 

## **Project Background and Objectives tes** 

Airbnb is a famous internet marketplace for short term home and apartment rentals. It allows ordinary people who own properties to list them out to make extra cash. One challenge that property owners or rentals face is to determine optimal nightly rent price (property owners) or to determine the if an advertised price is worth the money (customers).  

Airbnb site provides a good selection of listings that can be filtered by locations, price, number of bedrooms, and more. Although Airbnb provides hosts with general guidelines, there is no easy way to determine the best price to rent out a space. There were many options currently that allows host to determine the optimal rental price and most of them charge a hefty price.  

The purpose of this project is to utilize historical Airbnb data with machine learning models to predict the rental price of a given space. This prediction can be framed as a tool for potential customers to identify a fair price for a listing they are interested in, or for a property owner to set a fair price for their space. The model will also incorporate historical weather trends. Due to the short timeline for this project, the scope will be limited to only a few specific cities: Nashville, TN, [TBD], and [TBD]. 

The Eat.Sleep.Data team has an idea of using Machine Learning tool to predict optimal price a property owner should charge or a best value price a customer should pay while listing or renting a property. The team will focus on the city of Nashville as a model city. The input data feature will be based on location, weather, number of rooms, and more with the price being the Y feature.  

 
 

## **Data Source** 
 

The Airbnb site no longer allow user to apply access to their APIs therefore the team has researched and found that the following sites offer the data the team needs for this project. The Airbnb data is current and offers listing information as recent as calendar year 2021.  The team will also utilize the Weather APIs site to determine if price is affected by weather or seasons.
