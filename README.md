# **Eat.Sleep.Data - Predicting Airbnb Prices in Nashville** 
<hr>

## SUMMARY
The purpose of this project is to analyze historical Airbnb data with machine learning models to predict the optimal rental price of a given space based on location, size, amenities, reviews, host performance, and other relevant variables. This prediction model will be incorporated in a tool for property owners to use to determine the optimal rental price for their space and for customers to identify if the rental price for a listing is a fair value. The model will incorporate seasonal tourism trends and attractions to adjust the suggested price for the dates the space will be listed or rented. Due to the short timeline for this project, the scope will be limited to the Nashville, TN market.
