# **Eat.Sleep.Data - Predicting Airbnb Prices in Nashville** 
<hr>

## SUMMARY
The purpose of this project is to analyze historical Airbnb data with machine learning models to predict the expected rental price of a given space based on location, size, amenities, reviews, host performance, and other relevant variables. This prediction model will be incorporated in a tool for property owners to use to determine the rental price for their space. The model will incorporate seasonal trends and weekday versus weekend differences to adjust the suggested price for the dates the space will be listed or rented. Due to the short timeline for this project, the scope will be limited to the Nashville, TN market. 

**Team members:** Alex Conerly, Alex Felice, Betsy Wellington, Hannah Koivisto, Ken Liew, Whitney Losinski

### Reason for selecting this topic

In order to find a project, the team scoured Kaggle datasets and other internet sources of data to find potential projects that were of interest to each member.  These potential projects and the associated dataset were added to a shared spreadsheet.  After collecting a number of potential projects, team members voted on the ones they were most interested in ranking them 1-3.  The project that received the highest score is the Airbnb proposal.  This was initially proposed by a member who mentioned that they had been thinking about having an Airbnb in their home and it might be interesting to find out how much rent they could get for it.  There is also an abundance of data available in open sources which makes this topic easier to develop.  

## Questions we hope to answer with the data

Looking at the wide variety of data available, the team is interested in exploring how the price charged relates to various features of the dataset.  While we are exploring all the variables available, the big question is what really makes a difference in the price that an Airbnb can command.  Here are some of the biggest features we hope to sort out:

*  Neighborhood
*  Privacy 
*  Number of bedrooms/beds
*  Kitchen
*  Pet friendly
*  Time of year or day of week
*  etc.

### Communication Protocols
 
Our team is using Discord for messaging.  Our discord board includes a "general" tab for informational messages, a "data-discovery" tab for information on datasets, and "important_and_useful_links" for the links to the sourced database, the Postgres database, the web app and any other important links.  We also have the ever important "off-topic" tab for general socializing. 

We are holding team meetings on Zoom which consists of both scheduled and impromptu meetings set up through our Discord channel.   

We are organizing and documenting tasks on a Trello board.  Our board can be viewed <a href= "https://trello.com/eatsleepdata">here.</a> 

Our programming and collaborative work is being done via Github.
