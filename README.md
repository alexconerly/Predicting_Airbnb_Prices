# **Eat.Sleep.Data - Predicting Airbnb Prices in Nashville** 
<hr>

## SUMMARY
The purpose of this project is to analyze historical Airbnb data with machine learning models to predict the optimal rental price of a given space based on location, size, amenities, reviews, host performance, and other relevant variables. This prediction model will be incorporated in a tool for property owners to use to determine the optimal rental price for their space and for customers to identify if the rental price for a listing is a fair value. The model will incorporate seasonal tourism trends and attractions to adjust the suggested price for the dates the space will be listed or rented. Due to the short timeline for this project, the scope will be limited to the Nashville, TN market.

### Communication Protocols
 
Our team is using Discord for messaging.  Our discord board includes a "general" tab for informational messages, a "data-discovery" tab for information on datasets, and "important_and_useful_links" for the links to the sourced database, the Postgres database, the web app and any other important links.  We also have the ever important "off-topic" tab for general socializing. 

We are holding team meetings on Zoom which consists of both scheduled and impromptu meetings set up through our Discord channel.   

We are organizing and documenting tasks on a Trello board.<a href= "https://trello.com/eatsleepdata">trello.com</a>
